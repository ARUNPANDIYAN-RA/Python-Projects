## Project overview 🎯
---
Explored maternal vital signs of pregnent women based on her own data during the pregnency period between month one to month eight. 


We have used imported pandas for automation like cleaning the dataset and exploring statistic analysis and used matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.

---

• The dataset consists of variables like
### Visit_Number, Month, Systolic_BP, Diastolic_BP, Weight_KG, Pulse_Rate, date_of_visit 🧾

---

## Procedures 🔎
---
• Imported Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
• Loaded the dataset
• Extracted the info from the dataset to check the variable names, number of columns present, variable names, null value present or not, datatypes of the variables
• converted the object datatype to appropriate datetime datatype
• Explored the statistical summary of the datas like count, mean, std deviation, min, quantiles, max
• Replaced the datatypes of few variables from integer to float due to finding the outliers of the variables-the mean of the outliers will result in float 
• Correlation between variables were explored
• Visualization between the variables had been figured out with graphs and charts
